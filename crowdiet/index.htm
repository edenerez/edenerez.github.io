<h1>The Bar-Ilan Crowdiet Project</h1>
 <h2>Project description:</h2>   

    The aim of the crowdiet project is to construct a multi-viewpoint ontology for the domain of diet and its effect on human health. The applied methodology incorporates crowdsourcing, collaborative ontology engineering and machine learning techniques. The ontology currently focuses on meat, dairy and soy-based products and contains approximately 750 statements (RDF triples).
